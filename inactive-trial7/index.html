              <p>Now, if you’re still not convinced, let me offer you this:</p>-->

              <h3 class="text-center section-title rounded-top p-4 mb-0">Cancel Anytime, No Questions Asked!</h3>
              <div class="blue-section p-4 rounded-bottom mb-5">
                <p>This should be the icing to the cake.</p>
                <p>If you join eCompreneur and you did not get any value out of it, you can contact us to <u>cancel your membership at anytime</u>. We won’t ask you why or bother you with details.</p>
                <p>Simply just contact us and we’ll cancel your membership right away so you will no longer be billed for your monthly subscription. We only want serious individuals anyways. If you are planning to join today and in the back of your mind, you’re thinking of canceling already, I encourage you not to join.</p>
                <p>Why? Because your mindset is set up to fail and we do not want failures in our program.</p>
                <p>However, I get it. Sometimes, maybe eCommerce isn’t the right thing for you and if you have tried eCompreneur and still don’t feel it’s the right business model for you, just contact us and we will cancel your membership at anytime.</p>
                <p>So here’s a recap on exactly what you’re entitled to as a member of eCompreneur:</p>

                <p class="text-center value mt-4"><em>Total Value: $1,950 USD</em></p>

                    If you’re already looking for the cancellation policy, then we encourage you NOT to join eCompreneur. We are not trying to be offensive in any way as we would love you to join but if you’re already in the mindset to quit then you will not succeed. Surely, you can build an eCom business all by yourself but it will be much faster when you have a coach to guide you along the way, plus the automation tools to help you kickstart your business. That said, if you really think that eCommerce is not for you, you can request to cancel at anytime you wish. Doing so, you will no longer be charged for your next recurring payment and any payments after that. However,  the payment for the current month will not be refunded.

Some people may see results as quickly as the first week of implementing, and other may take a longer time.

                    eCompreneur saves you time and money by providing you with the training and automation tools to help you build your own eCommerce business. There will be no additional selling from us, you just simply need to cover your recurring subscription payments. However, you will need to invest in the cost of advertising, your eCommerce site (i.e. Shopify), and other costs such as website domain, any outsourcing work such as logo designs etc.
