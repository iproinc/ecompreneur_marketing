                From the desk of Fred Lam <br>
                Vancouver, British Columbia<br><br>

                Dear eCompreneur, <br><br>

                I want to invite you to my first-ever, 3-day live event in my hometown, Vancouver, Canada. It’s specifically for those of you who want to learn from the best entrepreneurs in our industry to grow and scale your business.<br><br>

                It has taken me over 3 years to finally put together my first annual event.<br><br>

                It’s called Marketer’s In Black (M.I.B.).<br><br>

                This event is different than any other events you normally attend.<br><br>

                I’ll be pulling behind the curtains to share with you the top strategies and growth hacks that you can quickly implement for your business to see results.<br><br>

                These strategies and growth hacks are not just for those who owns an eCommerce business, but any type of online business you have. From affiliate marketing, email marketing, digital publishing, local businesses, agencies and the whole 9 yards.<br><br>

                In fact, I’ll be twisting some arms from my network of 7 to 8-figure entrepreneurs to share with you their best-kept strategies that helped them scale their own business so you can replicate their wins towards your business.<br><br>

              </p>

              <img class="w-100 my-4" src="../mib/images/speakers.jpg" alt="Entrepreneurs">

              <p>
                During this 3-day live event, I have a mission. <br><br>

                My mission comes into 3 parts. Each part plays a major role in any businesses, especially if you are running an eCommerce business and I want you to master them. They are: 
              </p>

              <h3 class="text-center my-4 py-4">Strategies, High-Performance Media Buying Skills & Growth-Hacking</h3>

              <p>Each part is broken down into 3 full day of extensive training that you won’t learn elsewhere.</p>

              <p>
                To generate profit for your business, you need to have strategies and to become a successful entrepreneur, you cannot rely on just one single strategy. You need to learn every possible strategies that you can use to apply for your business. <br><br>
  
                During day 1, I myself and along with my network of millionaires will be sharing with you our best-kept strategies that you can use for your business. We will only be sharing with you strategies that you can implement and most importantly these strategies would have produced a minimum 6-figures in sales before we even share them what they are

                Traffic is the lifeblood of any businesses. <br><br>

                In order for you to generate traffic on demand, you need to have High-Performance Media Buying Skills. To run a wildly-successful business, you don’t want to solely rely on a single traffic source such as Facebook Ads. <br><br>

                If you do that, you’re business will be at risk. <br><br>

                In day 2, I’ll be revealing my top traffic sources and share with you how you can implement them for your business. I will also be inviting top media buyers around the world who runs a minimum of 7-figure campaigns a year to even be on stage to share with you their tactics that they have been using.
