              <p>It is no longer a secret that eCommerce is one of the easiest and fastest way for anyone, including you, to create a highly-profitable online business.</p>
              <p>Every day,  new 6-figure earners and even millionaires are borned by harvesting this trillion dollar eCommerce industry. To be exact, according to Statista, eCommerce will be a <strong><u>$4.48 trillion dollar industry by 2020</u></strong>.</p>
              <p>If you do your quick math, a fraction of this trillion dollar industry may turn into millions of dollars a year for you.</p>
              <p>However, the magic question boils down to, “How Can I?”</p>
              <p>The answer is simple.</p>

                <p>What you see above is a real-time leaderboard on the sales figure that my students have collectively generated ever since they started following my blueprint.</p>
                <p>The crazy part? </p>
                <p>This proven blueprint is growing as high as <strong><u>$100,000 in collective students’ results</u></strong>.</p>

                <p>I developed this blueprint through my decade of experience of being an eCommerce entrepreneur. In fact, I was already generating millions before Shopify even existed.</p>
                <p>In 2008, I created my first eCommerce business and in just a few short months, it went <strong><u>from $0 to $4.8 million in sales</u></strong>.</p>

                <p>In 2011, I created two additional eCommerce businesses right at the same time, and both crossed over <strong><u>$2 million in sales</u></strong>.</p>

                <p>Despite of all these successes, I actually started as a dishwasher. I’m sharing this with you not to impress you but to impress upon you.</p>
                <p>I looked back to see what I did and how I did it.</p>
                <p>I started documenting what I’ve been doing to look for patterns and found that I have been following the same system and process the entire time.</p>
                <p>I interviewed my 6 to 7-figure students and many other successful eCommerce entrepreneurs to see what makes them successful.</p>
                <p>I even interviewed other people who are stuck and not being able to succeed with eCommerce.</p>
                <p>Then, I discovered the <strong><u>3 Core Pillars</u></strong> to turn any serious individuals to become a successful eCommerce entrepreneur.</p>

              <img src="../offer/images/pillars.svg" alt="Pillars" class="float-right w-25 ml-3 hide">
              <p>Let’s face it, creating an online store today is easy, but how to turn it into a <strong><u>revenue-generator</u></strong> is the missing key that most people have not yet cracked the code to.</p>
              <p>With my 3 Core Pillars, it can turn <u>any individual</u> into owning a <strong><u>highly-profitable eCommerce business</u></strong> even if you have zero knowledge or experience.</p>
              <p>Let’s take a look at the 3 Core Pillars.</p>
              <img src="../offer/images/pillars.svg" alt="Pillars" class="mobile w-50 mx-auto mb-2">
                <div class="media dark-bg">
                  <div class="media-body">
                    <h4 class="pt-5">Core Pillar #1: Automation</h4>

                </div>
                <div class="border border-primary rounded-bottom p-4 mb-3">
                  <p>Setting up your first eCommerce store is easy. You can Youtube them or read up free tutorials online to show you how.</p>
                  <p>But what is really missing in most of these and the real secret is: <strong><u>automation</u></strong>.</p>
                  <p>We all know time is money and successful people always say, Rich People Buy Time.</p>
                  <p>If you build your store without automation, you will be sucked into a typical 9 to 5 job which will make you unproductive and not being able to generate any results for your business.</p>
                  <p>In fact, <strong><u>automation can make your business A LOT more revenue</u></strong> which leads to even <strong><u>more profit</u></strong>. There are several key automations that you need for your eCommerce business but out of all those, there’s one critical one.</p>
    				      <p>It’s called <strong><u>Shopzie</u></strong>.</p>
                  <p>Shopzie is simply like a robot for your store. You can get access to millions of products to sell and with just one-click of a button, you will automatically have this product right in your store. Not only that, whenever a customer buys from you, you don’t need to waste time on fulfilling orders because <strong><u>Shopzie does it all for you</u></strong>.</p>
                  <p>The best part, Shopzie doesn’t just automate your store, but it gives you the ability to <strong><u>earn up to 6.9% cashback for every order placed</u></strong>, which means more money in your pocket without doing more.</p>
                  <p>Today, if you become an eCompreneur member, <u>you can get this automation software for <strong>free</strong></u>.</p>
                  <p>With the first Core Pillar: Automation handled, you will now have more time to focus things that <u>generates your sales</u>.</p>

              </div>
              <div class="border border-primary rounded-bottom p-4 mb-3">
                <p><strong><u>Traffic is the lifeblood of an eCommerce business</u></strong>.</p>
                <p>You can have the best product, the best deal, but without the skill to generate traffic and find hungry customers that are desperate to give you their money, you will not have a business.</p>
                <p>There are many forms of traffic that are available to you today. But the scary part is that if you do not know what you are doing with traffic, you can lose a lot of money.</p>
                <p>This is where most people fail when it comes to building a wildly-successful eCommerce business.</p>
                <p>The truth is, this was a big challenge and problem for me at first as well when I first got started.</p>
                <p>I knew that traffic is key and it’s a skill that wasn’t easy to master. The only way I can get this skill was to roll up my sleeves and figure it out myself.</p>
                <p>From the start of my eCommerce journey till now, I have spent millions of dollars of my own money out of my own pocket to generate traffic.</p>
                <div class="highlight-blue mb-4 p-4">
                  <p class="text-primary">When it comes to generating traffic, there are just <strong>two important platform</strong> to use.</p>
                  <p class="text-primary"><strong>Facebook and Google Ads</strong>.</p>
                  <p>These platforms are monstrous when it comes generating traffic, however, you need to know what you’re doing in order for you to even generate profit with them.</p>
                  <p>When you go into these platforms blind-folded, <u>you are setup to fail</u>.</p>
                  <p>Why? The answer is simple.</p>
                  <p>Both of these platforms look simple but they have a lot of pitfalls. These pitfalls are costly and in fact, I even lost hundreds of thousands of dollars for me to figure out what they are.</p>
                  <p>I have to admit, even the setup process in both <u>Facebook Ads and Google Ads are flawed</u>. It is setup for you to fail. It may look simple, but what you click and how you create your campaigns affect your sales drastically. Even when they say it is “Best Practice”, they can be costly if you setup incorrectly.</p>
                  <p>How do I know? Well, I tested with my own money viciously to find out and <u>I bet most top advertisers don’t even know</u>.</p>
                  <p>On top of that, you need to understand the <strong><u>psychology behind an ad</u></strong>. Even though Facebook and Google Ads makes it easy for anyone to buy traffic, but if you do not understand the ultimate core and purpose of these ads or how these people interact with your ads, you are going to be at a very vulnerable state.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Through my decades of experience and having coached tens of thousands of students on buying traffic, <strong><u>I invented my 3S Method to traffic</u></strong>.</p>
                <p>They are: <strong>Stalk, Setup & Strategies</strong>.</p>
                <p>The 3S Method works together as a whole. Without either one of them you will not be able to build a profitable eCommerce business.</p>
                <p>Within my 3S Method, <strong><u>Strategies is super important</u></strong>.</p>
                <p>For Strategies, there are many little hacks that can be applied to your traffic generation gameplan. One of them makes a massive impact for Facebook Ads and it requires a tool to do so.</p>
                <p>This tool is called <strong><u>Tiny.ie</u></strong>.</p>
                <p>It’s a <u>results-driven tool</u> that will allow you to <strong>increase your clicks, lower your cost per sale</strong> and most importantly, <strong><u>it is capable to do things that you cannot do with traditional Facebook Ads</u></strong>.</p>
                <p>And today, not only are you going to have an <u>opportunity to learn</u> and master my 3S Method to traffic, you’ll even get <strong><u>Tiny.ie access for free</u></strong> to help you bank in the most sales with your eCommerce business.</p>

                <p>Why? Because your mindset is set up to fail and we do not want failures in our program.</p>
                <p>However, I get it. Sometimes, maybe eCommerce isn’t the right thing for you and if you have tried eCompreneur and still don’t feel it’s the right business model for you, just contact us and we will cancel your membership at anytime.</p>
                <p>So here’s a recap on exactly what you’re entitled to as a member of eCompreneur:</p>

                <p class="text-center value my-4"><em>Total Value: $1,950 USD<br><span class="crossout">Just $97 USD/Month</span></em></p>
                <p class="text-center discount">50% Off Today: Just $49 USD/Month</p>

                    If you’re already looking for the cancellation policy, then we encourage you NOT to join eCompreneur. We are not trying to be offensive in any way as we would love you to join but if you’re already in the mindset to quit then you will not succeed. Surely, you can build an eCom business all by yourself but it will be much faster when you have a coach to guide you along the way, plus the automation tools to help you kickstart your business. That said, if you really think that eCommerce is not for you, you can request to cancel at anytime you wish. Doing so, you will no longer be charged for your next recurring payment and any payments after that. However,  the payment for the current month will not be refunded.

                    eCompreneur saves you time and money by providing you with the training and automation tools to help you build your own eCommerce business. There will be no additional selling from us, you just simply need to cover your recurring subscription payments. However, you will need to invest in the cost of advertising, your eCommerce site (i.e. Shopify), and other costs such as website domain, any outsourcing work such as logo designs etc.
